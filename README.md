# Żmij

A double-to-string conversion algorithm based on [Schubfach](https://fmt.dev/papers/Schubfach4.pdf)
and [yy](https://github.com/ibireme/c_numconv_benchmark/blob/master/vendor/yy_double/yy_double.c)

## Features

* Round trip guarantee
* Shortest decimal representation
* Correct rounding
* High [performance](#performance)
* Fast [compile time](#compile-time)
* Negative zero dependencies
* Small, clean codebase consisting of one [source file](
  https://github.com/vitaut/zmij/blob/main/zmij.cc) and one [header](https://github.com/vitaut/zmij/blob/main/zmij.h)
* Permissive [license](https://github.com/vitaut/zmij/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Usage

```c++
#include "zmij.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char buf[zmij::buffer_size];
  zmij::dtoa(6.62607015e-34, buf);
  puts(buf);
}
```

## Performance

More than 3x faster than [Ryu](https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu) used by multiple
C++ standard library implementations and ~2x faster than
[Schubfach](https://github.com/vitaut/schubfach)
on [dtoa-benchmark](https://github.com/fmtlib/dtoa-benchmark) run on Apple M1.

## Compile time

Compile time is ~60ms by default and ~68ms with optimizations enabled as measured by

```
% time c++ -c -std=c++20 zmij.cc [-O2]
```

taking the best of 3 runs.


## Differences from Schubfach

* 1 instead of 3 multiplications by powers of 10 in the common case
* Faster logarithm approximations
* Faster division and modulo
* Fewer conditional branches
* More efficient significand and exponent output
* Simpler storage of powers of 10 significands

## Name

Żmij (pronounced roughly zhmeey or more precisely /ʐmij/) is a Polish word that refers
to a mythical dragon- or serpent-like creature. This continues the dragon theme [started
by Steele and White](https://fmt.dev/papers/p372-steele.pdf). Nice feature of this name
is that it has a floating point in it.
